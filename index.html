<h1 style="color: chartreuse;">Once upon a time there was a frog</h1>
<h2 style="color: darkcyan;">She was a very beautiful frog but very lonely</h2>
<p>The frog decided to go to the ball in the swamp.</p>
<p>She was about to wear her beautiful dress but she didn't realize that she gained weight after lockdown.</p>
<p>The dress could barely close but she managed by using duct tape</p>
<p>At the ball she ate some delicious <em>time flies -</em> woah it's 3 AM, what happened?</p>
