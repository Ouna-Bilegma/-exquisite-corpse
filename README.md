This morning I saw a neighbor talking to her cat, it was obvious that she thought her cat understood her...  
I came to my house,I told my dog...   
we laughed a lot.  

Talking to your cats :smiley_cat: is very fun.  
When I talk to mine, I'm sure they understand me.  
Because when I shout: "Nala, Zazou, dinner!" they're running towards me at high speed.
