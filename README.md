# On dogs, cats and babies
This morning I saw a neighbor talking to her cat, it was obvious that she thought her cat understood her...
I came to my house,I told my dog...
we laughed a lot.

Talking to your cats :smiley_cat: is very fun.
When I talk to mine, I'm sure they understand me.
Because when I shout: "Nala, Zazou, dinner!" they're running towards me at high speed.

Some stories are very hard to add to. 
They are born short but complete. Like beautiful babies. 
What is the point of a beautiful baby? I prefer ugly alien-looking horrorbabies. They can only improve.
